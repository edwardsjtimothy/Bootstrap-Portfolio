        <section id="bio">
          <p class="tab">Hello! My name is Tim. I graduated from Belmont University in 2014 with a degree in English
            literature and a minor in history.
            In the years since graduating from university, I have tried my hand at quite a few different potential
            careers
            but none of them felt right for me. Last summer, a couple good friends who work in web development
            encouraged me to give programming a shot. I really enjoyed what I was able to learn and do in my spare time
            so I
            quit my job, jumped in, and haven't looked back.</p>
          <p class="tab">Other than being a fledgling web developer, I enjoy reading almost anything and writing
            creative fiction, playing music, working out, and being outside. I love playing
            board and table top games with my wife and friends; we get into a lot of DnD, Twilight Imperium, and
            Warhammer 40k. I am
            very into miniture painting for the purposes of Warhammer and DnD and would like to enter my work in
            competition at some point.</p>
