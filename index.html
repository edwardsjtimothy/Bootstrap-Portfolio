      <section id="bio">
          <p class="tab">Hello! My name is Tim. I graduated from Belmont University in 2014 with a degree in English literature and a minor in history.
          In the years since graduating from university, I have tried my hand at quite a few different potential careers
          but none of them felt right for me. Last summer, a couple good friends who work in web development 
          encouraged me to give programming a shot. I really enjoyed what I was able to learn and do in my spare time so I 
          quit my job, jumped in, and haven't looked back.</p>
          <p class="tab">Other than being a fledgling web developer, I enjoy reading almost anything and writing creative fiction, playing music, working out, and being outside. I love playing 
              board and table top games with my wife and friends; we get into a lot of DnD, Twilight Imperium, and Warhammer 40k. I am 
              very into miniture painting for the purposes of Warhammer and DnD and would like to enter my work in competition at some point.</p>
